 ### Hi there 👋 I am Witenberg Souza \o/

## About me
   > Houdie ! My name is Witenbeg Souza. I have a Master's in Electrical Engineering  through Northern Illinois University. My focus is on Statistical Detection Theory and Machine Learning.
   
  #### What are my hobbies?
   > I believe no one can be defined by only one aspect of their lives. Thus, I am always experimenting... creating new engineering projects, sharing ideas, diving into collabs, testing my embbeded devices, and when I have some spare time, trying new recipies in the kitchen.
